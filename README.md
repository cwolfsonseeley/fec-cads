Before beginning, run `meta/data-dictionaries.R` to create the data dictionary files. Then just run the numbered scripts in the `r/` directory in order, starting with `1-preprocess.R`

Data is downloaded from the FEC ([ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC](ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC)). Additional data on committees (such as category, etc) that is appended in `5-add-context.R` comes from the Committee for Responsive Politics ([http://www.opensecrets.org/](http://www.opensecrets.org/)).
